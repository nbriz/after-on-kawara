# after-on-kawara

my piece entitled "After On Kawara" is an homage to conceptual artist On Kawara's series of date paintings (the Today series) in which the artist would paint the day's date by hand onto a canvas. the works always followed the same formula, white text, black background (w/a few exceptions), centered on the canvas. this piece implements that formula in code, algorithmically generating a new "date painting" each day like *magic*.

the Art Institute of Chicago has a few in their collection. i get free access to the museum b/c i teach at SAIC, && would often spend time in the modern wing. Kawara's date paintings have always been among my fav works in the collection. they're aesthetically v simple, but conceptually layered. a dichotomy i always find myself drawn to. i haven't stepped foot in the museum in over a year. time feels so different these days.

i've read that Kawara would draw these w/out the help of any stencils or tools. if that's ture, how he kept his lines so straight is a mystery to me. i imagine that working on these paintings on a daily basis must have been meditative for him, therapeutic maybe. i've always felt that programming share's a lot w/conceptual art practices, but this aspect of the practice is definitely *lost* in the transcoding of the work.

like Kawara's series, my code is relatively simple. barely over 50 lines of code, generously spaced, including some unconventional spacing on the JavaScript months array, which is meant to appear like a K. the piece updates itself, so i don't imagine myself revisiting the code very often, but there are a few modifications i'd like to make to keep the algorithm "true" to the original formula. at the moment the dates always appear in English, though i had read once that Kawara would often draw the dates in the language + style of the local newspaper where he produced each painting. in the future i'd like to leverage the WWWeb's ability to query the user's location data (or their device's language settings) so that the language/date format always reflect those of the visitor,

...when i find the time.
